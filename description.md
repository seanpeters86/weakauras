## Configuration Notes
This aura uses a Dynamic Group Grid to organize and resize each aura. This means that by adjusting the order the aura is in the weak aura screen it will update the priority of that order accordingly. By default the first 5 icons are in row 1, the next 6 are row 2, and the last 6 are row 3. These settings can be updated or changed if you are looking for a different setup. If you want to add anything to track, or remove anything doing so can easily be done without changing the layout of the auras. 

This aura ships with 3 auras baseline but inside the custom grid code you can edit this to whatever combination you would prefer. I have included setting presets for the 3 row and 4 row design should you wish. Note that any changes you make to this custom code might significantly alter the aura, so make sure to do changes carefully.

In this package most of the auras that track buffs will only show when these buffs are active. This behavior allows you to use the other space for lower priority cooldowns while the buffs are not active. This can be changed manually of course if you prefer.

To see these features in action [here is a video going over the new package](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4ks2ex-mkA) for Dragonflight.
