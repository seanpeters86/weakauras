The following talents have been removed:

Surging Blaze
Focused Fury
Developer’s note: Convection and Focused Fury were intended to be flex talents to help you get a bit more single target damage while in an AOE build. However, the combination of these two talents were making Living Bomb so powerful in single target that it was overshadowing spells like Pyroblast. We don’t have a problem with Living Bomb being present in single target builds, but it shouldn’t be one of your highest damage contributors. Given the design of Focused Fury, it stands very opposed to this principle, and thus we opted to remove it.
Burning Blood damage bonus reduced to 8% and health threshold increased to 35%.
Burning Blood has been renamed to Molten Fury.
Heat Shimmer’s proc now makes your next Scorch instant cast (was deal 25% increased damage).
Developer’s note: We’re being sensitive to giving Fire more instant-cast spells and will be watching this talent carefully to make sure it isn’t pushing Fire too far towards never having to cast.

Developer’s note: We’re cleaning up the Living Bomb talents. Our goal with these changes is to increase the appeal of Gate 3 Living Bomb talents. We still expect Living Bomb to be fairly appealing in single target and low-cleave situations, since the damage decrease from the following changes in low-target contexts is marginal, and we will be watching it closely.
